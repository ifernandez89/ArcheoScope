# Giza Plateau Analysis: Complete Functional Persistence Report

## Executive Summary

**LANDSCAPE-SCALE ORGANIZATION DETECTED**: The Giza Plateau complex exhibits strong functional gradients (AFPI range: 0.422) with the main plateau showing elevated persistence (AFPI = 0.894) and clear differentiation from natural desert baseline (AFPI = 0.472).
