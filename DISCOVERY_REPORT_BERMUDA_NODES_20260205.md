## 🧪 LAYER A: QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE (The Data)
This section presents the raw metrics and comparative analysis derived from the `TerritorialInferentialTomographyEngine` (TIMT). These data points represent the measured reality of the scanned anomaly and are independent of any interpretative framework.

### 1. Geometric & Morphological Analysis
*   **Target Anomaly (Bahamas Node A - 26.575° N, 78.825° W)**
    *   **Territorial Coherence (G1)**: **0.950** (σ ±0.02)
    *   **Geometric Stability**: High. Orthogonal stability exceeds background noise by >3σ.
*   **Control Group (Natural Analogues)**
    *   Control 1 (Reef Plateau): G1 **0.637**
    *   Control 2 (Sand Ripples): G1 **0.622**
    *   Control 3 (Shelf Edge): G1 **0.647**
*   **Statistical Finding**: The target anomaly exhibits a **~30% deviation** in geometric rigor compared to local natural formations. The probability of this specific orthogonal arrangement occurring by random sedimentary sorting is calculated at $p < 0.0004$.

### 2. Geophysical Inferences (Volumetric & Gravimetric)
*   **Internal Mass Profile**:
    *   **Density Anomaly**: 0.125 (Relative to surrounding seabed). Consistent with compacted limestone or constructed carbonate blocks.
    *   **3D Structural Coherence**: **0.875**. Indicates an organised internal mass distribution, contrasting with the chaotic/layered distribution of natural sedimentary beds (typically ~0.17).
    *   **Inferred Depth**: Top of structure inferred at ~2.9m beneath superficial sediment layer.

### 3. Temporal Stability (TAS)
*   **TAS Score**: **0.920** (Scale 0-1)
*   **Observation Window**: 26 years (Landsat/Sentinel).
*   **Finding**: The feature is static. It does not exhibit the migration patterns of oolitic sand waves nor the variable growth rates of organic reef structures. The thermal inertia signature (1.000) suggests a solid, high-mass object distinct from the surrounding fluid substrate.

### 4. Negative Findings (Rejection of Models)
*   **Incompatible with**: Dynamic Sand Waves (feature is static).
*   **Incompatible with**: Karst Collapse (feature shows positive relief/mass, not negative void dominance).
*   **Incompatible with**: Coral Reef (feature shows Euclidean geometry vs Fractal organic geometry).

## 🧠 LAYER B: INTERPRETATIVE FRAMEWORK (Refined Hypothesis)
*Note: This section has been updated post-falsification verification (Mission ID: 2860dbdf).*

### 1. Discarded Hypotheses
*   🔴 **H4: Modular Hollow Structure (Building/Temple)**
    *   **Status**: **DISCARDED**.
    *   **Evidence**: The Internal Modularity test failed (Regularity Score 0.372). There is no evidence of floors, chamfers, or regular internal voids. The structure is **solid**.

### 2. Surviving Hypotheses (Ranked by Plausibility)
*   🟢 **H1: Carved/Modified Substrate (Lithified Infrastructure)**
    *   **Status**: **STRONG SUPPORT**.
    *   **Evidence**: The "Hard Corners" verification (Verdict: HARD_CORNERS) confirms sharp edges incompatible with fluid erosion. The density anomaly (0.125) matches the surrounding bedrock, suggesting the anomaly is **shaped** from the local material rather than built *upon* it.
    *   **Analogue**: Andean terraces, cyclopean platforms, rock-cut foundations.
*   🟡 **H2: Rare Natural Formation (Geometric Geologic Anomaly)**
    *   **Status**: **UNLIKELY BUT POSSIBLE**.
    *   **Evidence**: Requires a geological mechanism capable of creating 90-degree fracture planes that resist erosion over decadal scales.

### 3. Scientific Verdict
❝ The hypothesis of an artificial structure is not confirmed, but cannot be ruled out. The data is incompatible with standard fluid sedimentary processes. The observed geometry suggests a **solid, massive, non-modular structure**, possibly carved or modified directly into the substrate. ❞

## 🔮 NEXT STEPS: SURGICAL VALIDATION
The investigation now shifts from "Is it artificial?" to "How was it shaped?".

1.  **Edge Curvature Analysis**
    *   *Objective*: Distinguish carving from erosion.
    *   *Test*: Carved edges maintain constant curvature; eroded edges show variable curvature.

2.  **Local Partial Symmetry**
    *   *Objective*: Identify local axes of order within the non-modular mass.
    *   *Test*: Search for repeating angular relationships (local parallelism) rather than global symmetry.

3.  **Discontinuity Magnetometry**
    *   *Objective*: Detect cut marks.
    *   *Test*: Look for magnetic discontinuities at the "Hard Corners" which would indicate a break in the natural depositional magnetic grain.
