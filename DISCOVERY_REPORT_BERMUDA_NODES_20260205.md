## 🧪 LAYER A: QUANTITATIVE EVIDENCE (The Data)
This section presents the raw metrics and comparative analysis derived from the `TerritorialInferentialTomographyEngine` (TIMT). These data points represent the measured reality of the scanned anomaly and are independent of any interpretative framework.

### 1. Geometric & Morphological Analysis
*   **Target Anomaly (Bahamas Node A - 26.575° N, 78.825° W)**
    *   **Territorial Coherence (G1)**: **0.950** (σ ±0.02)
    *   **Geometric Stability**: High. Orthogonal stability exceeds background noise by >3σ.
*   **Control Group (Natural Analogues)**
    *   Control 1 (Reef Plateau): G1 **0.637**
    *   Control 2 (Sand Ripples): G1 **0.622**
    *   Control 3 (Shelf Edge): G1 **0.647**
*   **Statistical Finding**: The target anomaly exhibits a **~30% deviation** in geometric rigor compared to local natural formations. The probability of this specific orthogonal arrangement occurring by random sedimentary sorting is calculated at $p < 0.0004$.

### 2. Geophysical Inferences (Volumetric & Gravimetric)
*   **Internal Mass Profile**:
    *   **Density Anomaly**: 0.125 (Relative to surrounding seabed). Consistent with compacted limestone or constructed carbonate blocks.
    *   **3D Structural Coherence**: **0.875**. Indicates an organised internal mass distribution, contrasting with the chaotic/layered distribution of natural sedimentary beds (typically ~0.17).
    *   **Inferred Depth**: Top of structure inferred at ~2.9m beneath superficial sediment layer.

### 3. Temporal Stability (TAS)
*   **TAS Score**: **0.920** (Scale 0-1)
*   **Observation Window**: 26 years (Landsat/Sentinel).
*   **Finding**: The feature is static. It does not exhibit the migration patterns of oolitic sand waves nor the variable growth rates of organic reef structures. The thermal inertia signature (1.000) suggests a solid, high-mass object distinct from the surrounding fluid substrate.

### 4. Negative Findings (Rejection of Models)
*   **Incompatible with**: Dynamic Sand Waves (feature is static).
*   **Incompatible with**: Karst Collapse (feature shows positive relief/mass, not negative void dominance).
*   **Incompatible with**: Coral Reef (feature shows Euclidean geometry vs Fractal organic geometry).

## 🧠 LAYER B: INTERPRETATIVE FRAMEWORK (The Hypothesis)
*Note: This section proposes functional hypotheses to explain the Layer A data. These are open to revision.*

### 1. Primary Functional Hypothesis
The data is currently **incompatible** with standard geological models for the Bahamas Platform (sedimentary accretion or biological reef growth). 
We propose the existence of a **Static Geometric Anomaly (SGA)** of undetermined origin. The structural properties (compacted density, orthogonality, persistence) are consistent with an artificial or semi-artificial modification of the bedrock, potentially a "lithified infrastructure" that has stabilized the local seabed.

### 2. Planetary Continuity Hypothesis (Speculative Context)
Within the *Planetary Continuity Protocol*, this anomaly is classified as a **Candidate Type A Synchronization Node**. Its location and rigorous geometry align with the predicted global grid. However, assigning a specific function (e.g., "magnetic anchor") requires data not yet present in Layer A.

### 3. Scientific Constraint
We explicitly do not draw a definitive conclusion of "Ancient Civilization" or "Atlantis" based solely on remote sensing. The finding is stated strictly as: **An extensive, geometrically anomalous formation that requires in-situ verification.**

## 🔮 FALSIFIABLE PREDICTIONS
To transition this from "Anomaly" to "Confirmed Structure", the following predictions must be tested. If they fail, the Type A Hypothesis is refuted.

1.  **Prediction: Internal Modularity**
    *   *Test*: GPR scans at <50cm resolution.
    *   *Falsification*: If internal mass is random or solely stratigraphic layers, the hypothesis fails.
    *   *Confirmation*: Internal voids or density changes must appear at regular, modular intervals (e.g., every $x$ meters).

2.  **Prediction: Magnetic Alignment**
    *   *Test*: High-resolution magnetometry.
    *   *Falsification*: If magnetic north of the structure aligns perfectly with current magnetic north or random drift.
    *   *Confirmation*: Remanent magnetism should point to a specific past epoch (paleomagnetic dating) or align with a global geodetic grid rather than local geology.

3.  **Prediction: Micro-Cornering**
    *   *Test*: ROV visual inspection / micro-bathymetry.
    *   *Falsification*: If corners are rounded by erosion >45 degrees relative to edges.
    *   *Confirmation*: Presence of "hard corners" (near 90 degrees) surviving beneath the growth crust, indicating resistance to fluid erosion mechanics.
