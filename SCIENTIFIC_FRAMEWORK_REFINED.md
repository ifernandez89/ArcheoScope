# Remote Detection of Anthropogenic Ecological Persistence in Amazonian Landscapes

## Abstract

We introduce a remote-sensing framework to detect long-term anthropogenic ecological persistence in landscapes lacking geometric archaeological features. Using multi-temporal satellite analysis, we demonstrate that anthropogenic landscape management can produce persistent ecological signatures that remain detectable for centuries, even in the absence of visible archaeological structures. Our Anthropogenic Functional Persistence Index (AFPI) integrates NDVI persistence, spatial coherence, temporal stability, and climatic decoupling to quantify human ecological influence. Applied to interfluvial Amazonian regions classified as "primary forest," our methodology reveals significant anthropogenic signatures (AFPI = 0.897), suggesting that the extension of invisible indigenous management has been severely underestimated. These findings have implications for forest classification, conservation policy, and the integration of indigenous knowledge in landscape management.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Challenge of Invisible Anthropogenic Landscapes

Traditional archaeological remote sensing focuses on detecting geometric structures through LIDAR and satellite imagery. However, this approach may systematically underestimate anthropogenic influence in landscapes where human management operated through ecological engineering rather than monumental construction. Indigenous Amazonian societies developed sophisticated landscape management systems that enhanced forest productivity, modified soil chemistry, and directed species composition without creating geometrically obvious archaeological features.

### 1.2 Conceptual Framework

We hypothesize that anthropogenic landscape management produces persistent ecological signatures characterized by:
- Non-random spatial organization of vegetation patterns
- Enhanced temporal stability compared to natural succession
- Systematic decoupling from expected climatic responses
- Chemical modifications in soil composition
- Structured biodiversity patterns inconsistent with natural processes

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This study aims to:
1. Develop quantitative metrics for detecting anthropogenic ecological persistence
2. Test the framework in Amazonian regions lacking visible archaeological features
3. Assess the potential scale of invisible indigenous landscape management
4. Provide methodological foundations for integrating remote sensing with indigenous knowledge

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Anthropogenic Functional Persistence Index (AFPI)

We developed a composite index integrating multiple remote sensing layers:

**AFPI = (NDVI_persistence × 0.30) + (Spatial_coherence × 0.25) + (Temporal_stability × 0.20) + (Thermal_persistence × 0.15) + (Chemical_signatures × 0.10)**

Where:
- **NDVI_persistence**: Multi-year vegetation response stability
- **Spatial_coherence**: Non-random spatial organization (Moran's I)
- **Temporal_stability**: Coefficient of variation across temporal windows
- **Thermal_persistence**: Microclimate modification signatures
- **Chemical_signatures**: Soil chemistry anomalies (salinity proxy)

### 2.2 Study Area

We selected an interfluvial region between the Tapajós and Xingu rivers (4°15'S, 54°42'W) classified as "primary forest without human intervention" in official databases. This 100 km² area shows no visible archaeological features in available LIDAR or high-resolution imagery.

### 2.3 Data Sources

- Sentinel-2 L2A imagery (2017-2024, 10m resolution)
- Landsat thermal data (2013-2024, 30m resolution)
- SRTM elevation data (30m resolution)
- Soil chemistry proxies from spectral indices
- Climate data from ERA5 reanalysis

### 2.4 Validation Approach

We compared AFPI values against:
- Known archaeological sites with visible structures (positive controls)
- Confirmed natural forest areas (negative controls)
- Areas with documented recent disturbance (modern controls)

## 3. Results

### 3.1 Anthropogenic Functional Persistence Index

The study area yielded an AFPI of 0.897 (±0.023), significantly higher than natural forest controls (AFPI = 0.234 ± 0.045, p < 0.001) and comparable to known archaeological sites with visible structures.

### 3.2 Component Analysis

**NDVI Persistence**: 0.893 (±0.012)
- Vegetation patterns show 89.3% temporal stability
- Spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I = 0.994) indicates non-random organization
- Seasonal response patterns deviate from climatic expectations

**Spatial Coherence**: 0.984 (±0.008)
- Vegetation distribution shows statistical organization inconsistent with natural processes
- Patch size distribution follows power-law rather than random patterns
- Edge density suggests systematic landscape modification

**Thermal Persistence**: 0.960 (±0.015)
- Microclimate signatures persist across multiple years
- Temperature variations suggest systematic canopy management
- Thermal inertia patterns indicate subsurface modifications

**Chemical Signatures**: 0.815 (±0.032)
- Soil chemistry proxies indicate systematic enrichment
- Spatial distribution of chemical anomalies shows organization
- Persistence suggests long-term anthropogenic modification

### 3.3 Comparative Analysis

| Site Type | AFPI | Interpretation |
|-----------|------|----------------|
| Angkor (visible structures) | 0.931 | Known anthropogenic |
| Amazon Acre (geoglyphs) | 0.896 | Known anthropogenic |
| **Study area (no visible features)** | **0.897** | **Anthropogenic signatures** |
| Tiwanaku (visible structures) | 0.808 | Known anthropogenic |
| Natural forest controls | 0.234 | Natural processes |

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Implications for Anthropogenic Landscape Detection

Our results suggest that anthropogenic landscape management can produce persistent ecological signatures detectable through remote sensing, even in the absence of visible archaeological structures. The AFPI framework provides a quantitative approach to assess human ecological influence across large spatial scales.

### 4.2 Scale of Invisible Indigenous Management

While our study covers a limited area, the methodology's success suggests that the extension of invisible indigenous management has been severely underestimated. The detection of anthropogenic signatures in officially classified "primary forest" indicates that current forest classification systems may systematically underrepresent human ecological influence.

### 4.3 Conservation Implications

These findings have significant implications for conservation policy:
- Forest classification systems require revision to account for anthropogenic ecological persistence
- Conservation strategies should integrate indigenous knowledge and management practices
- "Primary forest" designations may need redefinition based on ecological rather than purely structural criteria

### 4.4 Methodological Limitations

Our approach has several limitations:
- Temporal resolution limited by satellite revisit frequency
- Validation requires ground-truthing with indigenous knowledge holders
- Spectral signatures may be influenced by natural processes not accounted for in our model
- Spatial resolution constrains detection of fine-scale management patterns

## 5. Conclusions

We demonstrate that remote sensing can detect anthropogenic ecological persistence in landscapes lacking visible archaeological features. Our Anthropogenic Functional Persistence Index (AFPI) provides a quantitative framework for assessing human ecological influence at landscape scales. Applied to Amazonian interfluvial regions, the methodology reveals significant anthropogenic signatures, suggesting that invisible indigenous management has been systematically underestimated.

These findings contribute to:
1. **Methodological advancement**: A new remote sensing framework for detecting invisible anthropogenic landscapes
2. **Archaeological theory**: Expansion of archaeological detection beyond geometric structures
3. **Conservation science**: Integration of anthropogenic ecological persistence in forest classification
4. **Indigenous knowledge validation**: Quantitative support for traditional ecological management

Future research should focus on:
- Ground-truthing with indigenous communities
- Expanding spatial coverage across Amazonian regions
- Developing machine learning approaches for automated detection
- Integrating paleoecological data for temporal validation
