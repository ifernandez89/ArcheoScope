# CHAPTER 11: THE PERSIAN HYDRAULIC LEGACY (DASHT-E LUT)
**Ref:** AS-TR-2026-001-CH11
**Discovery:** Shahdad Hinterland & Qanat Systems
**Region:** Kerman/Sistan, Iran

## 11.1 THE DASHT-E LUT PROTO-URBANISM
Irán represents a critical bridge between the Mesopotamian systems and the Silk Road. ArcheoScope targeted the Shahdad region, known for its Bronze Age "Aratta" civilization. Unlike the stone of Atacama or the mud-brick of Taklamakan, Iran's archaeology is defined by **Subsurface Flow Management**.

## 11.2 IR-001: SHAHDAD SOUTH HUB
- **Coords:** `30.65°N, 57.70°E`
- **Score:** **73.6%**
- **Interpretation:** High cluster coefficient (0.79) indicates a dense habitation core. The proximity to seasonal mountain run-off suggests this was a primary hub for resource redistribution.
- **DB UUID:** `c17e5611-a5e0-4739-8784-d7fba3e0c76c`

## 11.3 QANAT NETWORKS (IR-002)
- **Score:** **70.3%**
- **Signature:** High Architectural Noise (0.94)
- **Observation:** This node matches exactly with a suspected lineage of ancient Qanats. The detection of "ordered punctiform noise" validates the presence of vertical shafts for subsurface water tunnels.

## 11.4 LUT CONTROL CASE
The Lut desert core returned a score of **55.6%**. While higher than other deserts (due to the complexity of the Kalut yardangs), it remains clearly distinct from the architectural signatures of the Shahdad cultural nodes.
