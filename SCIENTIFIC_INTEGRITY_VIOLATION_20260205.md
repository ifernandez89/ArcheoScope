# SCIENTIFIC INTEGRITY VIOLATION REPORT

**Date**: 2026-02-05  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: INVALIDATED

---

## ❌ VIOLATION: Synthetic Data Analysis

### What Happened:
A "surgical analysis" script (`mission_comparative_surgical.py`) was executed that:
1. **INVENTED synthetic image data** via `_generate_representative_data()`
2. **Performed geometric analysis** (ECA/LSS) on this FAKE data
3. **Generated a scientific report** (`COMPARATIVE_SURGICAL_REPORT_20260205.md`) presenting these fake results as real

### Why This Is Unacceptable:
**ArcheoScope Rule #1**: NEVER INVENT DATA. NEVER LIE.

The entire foundation of this system is built on:
- **Real satellite data** (Sentinel, Landsat, SRTM, etc.)
- **Transparent uncertainty**
- **Falsifiable predictions**

Generating synthetic images and analyzing them as if they were real sensor data **destroys scientific credibility**.

## 🗑️ INVALIDATED OUTPUTS:

The following files are **SCIENTIFICALLY INVALID** and must not be used:
- `COMPARATIVE_SURGICAL_REPORT_20260205.md` ❌
- `mission_comparative_surgical.py` ❌ (contains `_generate_representative_data()`)
- `mission_bermuda_surgical.py` ❌ (same issue)
- `SURGICAL_REPORT_BERMUDA_20260205.md` ❌

**Reason**: All "surgical" analyses were performed on **synthetic/invented data**, not real instrument measurements.

---

## ✅ CORRECTIVE ACTION:

### Immediate:
1. **Mark all surgical reports as INVALID**
2. **Do NOT use** any conclusions from these reports
3. **Document** this violation publicly

### Long-term Rule Enforcement:

**IRONCLAD RULE**:
```python
# NO CODE MAY EVER:
# 1. Generate synthetic sensor data for analysis
# 2. Simulate measurements without explicit "SIMULATED" status
# 3. Present derived/estimated data as direct measurements
# 4. Perform analysis on placeholder/mock data

# ACCEPTABLE:
# - Using real satellite data (with uncertainty metadata)
# - Explicitly labeled simulations (for testing ONLY)
# - Derived metrics (labeled as "DERIVED" or "INFERRED")

# UNACCEPTABLE:
# - np.random() to create "representative" images
# - Gaussian filters to simulate terrain
# - Any analysis on non-instrumental data presented as real
```

## 📋 Why We Can't Do "Surgical Analysis" Right Now:

To perform **valid** geometric analysis (edge curvature, symmetry), we need:
1. **Real SAR backscatter arrays** (not simulated)
2. **Real DEM elevation matrices** (not noise + gaussian)
3. **Real anomaly maps** generated by TIMT

**Current Problem**: The mission scripts don't have direct access to these real arrays from the TIMT engine.

**Invalid Solution** ❌: Invent synthetic data  
**Valid Solution** ✅: Either:
- Implement proper data extraction from TIMT
- OR don't do the analysis

**We chose the invalid path. This was wrong.**

## 🔒 SEAL: Data Integrity Commitment

From this point forward:
- **NO analysis** may be performed on synthetic data unless explicitly marked "SIMULATION" or "THEORETICAL"
- **ALL** sensor data must have provenance (source, timestamp, confidence)
- **ANY** derived metric must be labeled "DERIVED" or "INFERRED"
- **IF** real data is unavailable, the analysis **MUST NOT** proceed

This violation is documented to ensure it **NEVER happens again**.
