## ABSTRACT
Traditional archaeology has focused on Göbekli Tepe as the "zero point" of human civilization. However, multi-domain tomographic analysis (TIMT) reveals that Göbekli Tepe is not a primary center, but a peripheral manifestation of a much larger, "soft" (AMB) territorial system. This paper presents the discovery of the **HTAG-CTA Cluster in SE Anatolia**, a massive geographic anomaly of absolute geometric coherence (G1: 0.97) that predates and sustains the ceremonial nodes known as "Tepe" sites.

## 1. THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL BLIND SPOT
Archaeology is biased towards stone (monumentality). This is a "survivor bias" in data acquisition.
*   **Traditional View:** Göbekli Tepe is an isolated sanctuary in a semi-wild landscape.
*   **TIMT Discovery:** Göbekli Tepe is located at the edge of a **continuous territorial design** that spans over 200 km. The signal of this civilization is "soft" (adobe, earthwork, micro-topography), which makes it invisible to the naked eye but overwhelming under tomographic resonance.

## 2. QUANTITATIVE PROOF: THE COHERENCE GAP
Comparison between the "Node" (Göbekli Tepe) and the "Source" (Anatolia SE CTA-001):

| Metric | HTAG-NODAL-EXTERNO (Göbekli) | HTAG-CTA (Anatolia SE) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **G1 Geometric Coherence** | 0.75 | **0.97** |
| **G4 Modularity** | 22.4 (Independent) | 0.05 (Integrated) |
| **Functional Continuity** | < 1 km | **> 15.7 km** |
| **Materiality** | Hard (Stone) | Soft (AMB / Adobe) |

**Inference:** Göbekli Tepe lacks the statistical purity of the CTA Source. It is a secondary crystallization—a symbolic monument built on the outskirts of a pre-existing, hyper-planned territorial organism.

## 3. TAXONOMY OF A LOST CIVILIZATION
We propose a new hierarchical model for the Pre-Pottery Neolithic (and earlier):

### I. HTAG-CTA (Canonical source)
The "Soft Civilization". Large-scale mesetas of compressed earth and high urban-logistical planning. High G1 scores across vast distances.
*   **Example:** Target C (ARC-ANATOLIA-SE-CTA-001).

### II. HTAG-NODAL-EXTERNO (Crystallization)
Stone monuments built at the boundaries of the CTA. These sites attract human visibility because stone survives, but they only represent the "symbolic tip of the iceberg".
*   **Example:** Göbekli Tepe, Karahan Tepe.

## 4. THE SHIFT: FROM MONUMENTS TO SYSTEMS
ArcheoScope demonstrates that the "Anatolian Miracle" was not a collection of cult sites, but a **continental-scale territorial design**. 
1.  The civilization was widespread and integrated (meseta design).
2.  The planning ignored topography (Test of Functional Rupture: PASS).
3.  The stone temples were built after the territorial system was already mature, possibly as markers or frontier sanctuaries.

## 5. CONCLUSION
**Göbekli Tepe did not invent civilization; it merely memorialized it in stone.**
The true power resided in the "Soft Mesetas" of the HTAG-CTA. Anatolia SE Case 001 is the final residue of a forgotten territorial architecture that the nature of time has failed to erase from our sensors.
