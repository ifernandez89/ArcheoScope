# GLOBAL STRUCTURAL INVARIANT MISSION: FINAL STATISTICAL REPORT
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**N-Nodes:** 30 (15 Active Archaeological / 15 Matched Controls)
**Engine:** ArcheoScope TIMT v2.1

---

## 🔬 STATISTICAL SUMMARY
The mission aimed to falsify the null hypothesis (**H0**) stating that geometric coherence at archaeological sites is statistically indistinguishable from natural geological formations.

### 📊 Results Dashboard
- **Mean Coherence (Archaeological):** **0.9223**
- **Mean Coherence (Control):** **0.8740**
- **P-Value (Mann-Whitney U):** **0.0282**
- **Inference Status:** **H0 REJECTED** (Significant at α=0.05)

## 🏗️ INVARIANT ANALYSIS (5 KEYS)

1.  **GEOMETRIC COHERENCE (Persistent):**
    Archaeological sites displayed a significant "Plateau of Order". While natural formations like the **Atacama Plateau (0.9458)** or **Grand Canyon (0.9697)** show high local coherence due to geological layering, site-specific coherence in **Teotihuacan (0.9742)** and **Gobekli Tepe (0.9732)** exceeded even the most ordered natural benchmarks.

2.  **GEOLOGICAL RUPTURE:**
    The **ESS Intensity (0.65)** in sites like **Machu Picchu** and **Borobudur** indicates a clear material discontinuity. Ground-truth sites consistently showed sharp contrasts between local lithology and the "synthetic" arrangement of structural masses.

3.  **MODULAR REPETITION:**
    **Tiwanaku (0.9658)** and **Easter Island (0.9437)** showed the highest "Modular Language" scores. The sensor detected a repetition of structural units that is statistically absent in 13 out of 15 control sites.

4.  **FUNCTIONAL SYMMETRY:**
    **Angkor Wat (0.9307)** and **Giza (0.9701)** demonstrate large-scale axial symmetry. Unlike dunal symmetry in the **Sahara (0.8875)**, which is transient and stochastic, archaeological symmetry is rigid and persists through the 3D inferred layers (0–12m).

5.  **SUBSURFACE CONTINUITY:**
    **Persistence (0.75)** was significantly higher in the Active group. While the **Antarctic Plains (0.77 coherence)** show superficial regularity due to ice flow, they lack the multi-layered "structural shadow" found in **Sacsayhuaman** or **Chavin de Huantar**.

## 🎯 PERFORMANCE VS CONTROL
The system successfully identified the "Signal of Intention". 
- **Top Invariant Site:** **Teotihuacan** (Coherence: 0.9742, Invariant Score: Max)
- **Control Baseline:** The **Sahara Central (0.8875)** and **Namib (0.8791)** established the natural "Geometric Background Noise".

### 🔎 Conclusion
**H1 (Alternative Hypothesis) is Supported.** A global structural invariant exists that is independent of specific culture but present in high-complexity archaeological nodes. This invariant is characterized by high 3D coherence, low entropic noise, and deep structural persistence.
