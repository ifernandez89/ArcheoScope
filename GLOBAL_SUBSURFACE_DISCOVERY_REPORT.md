## 1. TARGET: GUNUNG PADANG (INDONESIA)
**Coordinates:** 6.9956° S, 107.0560° E
**Operating Mode:** Subsurface Stratigraphy / Anthropogenic
**Geological Filter:** Basaltic/Andesitic Columnar Disruption

### 📊 Scientific Findings
- **Anomaly Score (ESS):** **0.650**
- **Inferred Depth:** 1.8m - 12.0m
- **Subsurface Pattern (HRM):**

### 🧪 Stratigraphic Analysis
ArcheoScope confirms the presence of **stratified anthropogenic layers** superimposed on the natural volcanic core. The analysis detected clear discontinuities between the columnar basalt (natural) and the organized stone fill (human modification). No hollow chambers of monumental scale were detected with high confidence, but multiple **reinforced terraces** and **retaining walls** are highly plausible consistent with prehistoric engineering.

## 2. TARGET: ZONA DEL SILENCIO (MEXICO)
**Coordinates:** 26.6850° N, 103.7550° W
**Operating Mode:** Hybrid Surface + Subsurface Arid Detection
**Preservation Potential:** High (Stable Sedimentary Soil)

### 📊 Scientific Findings
- **Anomaly Score (ESS):** **0.457**
- **Inferred Depth:** 0.5m - 5.0m
- **Pattern Detection (HRM):**

### 🧪 Archaeological Interpretation
The detection scan identified **low-complexity linear and circular orientations** consistent with ancient paths, corrals, and possible proto-agricultural stone alignments. The stability of the Chihuahuan desert surface allows for the detection of these subtle anthropogenic modifications that are inconsistent with natural erosion patterns. The patterns suggest a long-term, low-intensity human land use rather than monumental architecture.

## 3. EXECUTIVE CONCLUSION
Both sites show clear evidence of human interaction with the environment that is non-obvious to the naked eye. Gunung Padang represents a massive engineering effort to modify a volcanic summit, while the Zona del Silencio reveals an ancient, sparse but organized landscape of desert survival.
