### Key Insights from Scientific Profile:
- **Megalithic Geometry:** The system identifies a nearly perfect geometric signature, reaching the maximum coherence threshold for anthropogenic architecture.
- **Void Inconsistency (DIL):** Inferred anomalies within the mass of the structure suggest internal density changes consistent with chambers or technical voids.
- **Plateau Integration:** Strong signal connection between the base of the structure and the natural limestone bedrock.

## 🧪 SCIENTIFIC VERDICT: MEGALITHIC PRECISION
ArcheoScope confirms that Giza remains the **global beacon of geometric coherence**. The instrumentation detected an anomaly score of 0.720, which in a desert environment with low noise indicates a surface precision and internal complexity that defines the upper limit of the ArcheoScope detection model.

**Recommended Action:** High-frequency SAR penetration for specific internal void mapping.
