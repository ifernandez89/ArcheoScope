- Potential for commentary/perspective pieces

## 🔧 Manuscript Preparation Strategy

### Version 1: Archaeological Focus (JAS/Antiquity)
- **Emphasis**: Archaeological significance and interpretation
- **Technical detail**: Moderate, focus on results
- **Case study**: Angkor as primary focus
- **Length**: 8,000-10,000 words
- **Figures**: 6 main + supplementary

### Version 2: Technical Focus (RSE/Archaeological Prospection)
- **Emphasis**: Methodological innovation and validation
- **Technical detail**: High, detailed algorithms and parameters
- **Case study**: Angkor as proof-of-concept
- **Length**: 6,000-8,000 words
- **Figures**: 8 main + extensive supplementary

### Version 3: Interdisciplinary Focus (Science/Nature/PNAS)
- **Emphasis**: Paradigm shift and broad implications
- **Technical detail**: Moderate, focus on significance
- **Case study**: Angkor + preliminary results from other sites
- **Length**: 4,000-6,000 words (strict limits)
- **Figures**: 4 main + supplementary online

## 📊 Competitive Analysis

### Existing Literature Gaps
1. **Static vs. Dynamic**: Current methods focus on structure detection, not functional persistence
2. **Temporal Integration**: Limited integration of multi-temporal satellite data with LIDAR
3. **Quantitative Metrics**: Lack of standardized metrics for archaeological system vitality
4. **Living Archaeology**: Concept of functional persistence largely unexplored

### Competitive Advantages
1. **Novel Question**: Shift from "what's there?" to "what's still functional?"
2. **Quantitative Framework**: Reproducible metrics and thresholds
3. **Multi-Layer Convergence**: Independent evidence sources increase confidence
4. **Benchmark Case**: Angkor provides ideal validation opportunity
5. **Practical Applications**: Clear implications for water management and restoration

### Potential Criticisms and Responses

**Criticism**: "Limited validation - only one site"
**Response**: Angkor provides ideal benchmark due to extensive existing data; methodology is designed for broader application

**Criticism**: "Functional persistence is subjective"
**Response**: Quantitative metrics (FPI) provide objective assessment; thresholds are empirically derived

**Criticism**: "Satellite resolution limitations"
**Response**: 10m resolution adequate for landscape-scale infrastructure; method complements rather than replaces high-resolution LIDAR

**Criticism**: "Temporal window too short (7 years)"
**Response**: Demonstrates proof-of-concept; longer time series will strengthen future applications

## 🎯 Marketing and Dissemination Strategy

### Pre-Submission
1. **Conference presentations**: SAA, EAA, CAA meetings
2. **Workshop organization**: "Living Archaeology" symposium
3. **Social media**: Twitter threads highlighting key findings
4. **Blog posts**: Accessible explanations for broader audience

### Post-Publication
1. **Press release**: University and journal press offices
2. **Media interviews**: Science journalism outlets
3. **Academic talks**: Invited lectures at major universities
4. **Policy briefings**: UNESCO, ICOMOS, heritage organizations

### Long-term Impact
1. **Follow-up studies**: Additional archaeological sites
2. **Methodological refinements**: Machine learning integration
3. **Software development**: Open-source ArcheoScope tools
4. **Training workshops**: Capacity building in developing countries
