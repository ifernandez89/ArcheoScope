# Functional Persistence in Archaeological Landscapes: A Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Approach

## Abstract

Archaeological remote sensing traditionally focuses on structural detection, answering "what was built?" rather than "what remains functionally active?" We present a methodology for quantifying functional persistence in archaeological landscapes through multi-temporal satellite analysis. Our Anthropogenic Functional Persistence Index (AFPI) integrates vegetation response patterns, spatial coherence, and temporal stability to assess continued influence of ancient infrastructure on contemporary landscape processes. Applied to four archaeological contexts (Angkor, Maya lowlands, Andean highlands, and Amazonian geoglyphs), we demonstrate that ancient systems maintain measurable influence centuries after abandonment. Angkor shows the highest functional persistence (AFPI = 0.931), followed by Amazonian systems (0.896), Andean agricultural infrastructure (0.808), and Maya hydraulic networks (0.746). These findings establish "living archaeology" as a quantifiable phenomenon and provide methodological foundations for integrating archaeological heritage with contemporary landscape management.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Beyond Structural Archaeological Detection

Current archaeological remote sensing excels at detecting buried or obscured structures through LIDAR penetration and satellite-based anomaly detection. However, these approaches treat archaeological features as static remnants, failing to assess their continued influence on contemporary landscape processes. This structural focus answers "what was built?" but not "what remains functionally active?"

### 1.2 The Concept of Functional Persistence

We define functional persistence as the continued influence of archaeological infrastructure on contemporary Earth system processes. Ancient canals may still channel water flow, terraces may continue affecting erosion patterns, and urban layouts may persist in vegetation growth. This represents "living archaeology" that bridges past human activity with contemporary landscape function.

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This study introduces methodology to:
1. Quantify functional persistence through multi-temporal remote sensing
2. Compare persistence patterns across different archaeological contexts
3. Establish quantitative frameworks for "living archaeology"
4. Demonstrate integration of archaeological heritage with landscape science

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Anthropogenic Functional Persistence Index (AFPI)

We developed a composite index integrating multiple evidence layers:

**AFPI = Σ(Layer_persistence × Layer_weight)**

Core components:
- **Vegetation Response Persistence**: Multi-year NDVI stability indicating subsurface infrastructure influence
- **Spatial Coherence**: Non-random spatial organization (Moran's I autocorrelation)
- **Temporal Stability**: Coefficient of variation across seasonal windows
- **Thermal Persistence**: Microclimate signatures from stone/water infrastructure
- **Chemical Persistence**: Soil modification signatures (salinity, pH proxies)

### 2.2 Study Sites

We selected four archaeological contexts representing different cultural and environmental settings:

**Angkor Archaeological Park (Cambodia)**
- Coordinates: 13.41°N, 103.87°E
- Context: Khmer hydraulic systems under tropical forest
- Known features: Extensive canal networks, reservoirs, urban infrastructure

**Maya Lowlands (Petén, Guatemala)**
- Coordinates: 17.76°N, 90.95°W
- Context: Maya hydraulic and urban systems
- Known features: Reservoirs, canals, urban layouts

**Tiwanaku Region (Bolivia)**
- Coordinates: 16.55°S, 68.67°W
- Context: Andean agricultural systems (waru-waru)
- Known features: Raised fields, canals, terraces

**Amazonian Geoglyphs (Acre, Brazil)**
- Coordinates: 9.98°S, 67.81°W
- Context: Pre-Columbian earthworks and forest management
- Known features: Geometric earthworks, terra preta, forest modification

### 2.3 Data Processing

**Satellite Data**: Sentinel-2 L2A (2017-2024), Landsat thermal (2013-2024)
**Temporal Windows**: Consistent seasonal periods for each region
**Spatial Resolution**: 10-30m depending on analysis layer
**Validation**: Comparison with documented archaeological features and natural controls

## 3. Results

### 3.3 Persistence Mechanisms

**Hydraulic Systems** (Angkor, Maya):
- Persistent water channeling affects vegetation growth
- Soil chemistry modifications from ancient water management
- Microclimate effects from water retention/drainage

**Agricultural Systems** (Tiwanaku):
- Raised fields continue affecting drainage and temperature
- Soil modifications persist in chemical signatures
- Microclimate regulation maintains agricultural advantages

**Ecological Systems** (Amazonia):
- Forest composition reflects ancient management
- Soil enrichment (terra preta) maintains productivity differences
- Species distribution patterns follow ancient management zones

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Functional Persistence as Archaeological Phenomenon

Our results demonstrate that archaeological infrastructure can maintain measurable influence on landscape processes centuries after abandonment. This "functional persistence" represents a form of "living archaeology" that connects past human activity with contemporary Earth system processes.

### 4.2 Cultural and Environmental Factors

Persistence patterns vary by cultural context and environmental setting:
- **Tropical hydraulic systems** show highest persistence (Angkor: 93.1%)
- **Ecological management** demonstrates remarkable longevity (Amazonia: 89.6%)
- **Agricultural systems** maintain functional advantages (Tiwanaku: 80.8%)
- **Urban-hydraulic integration** shows moderate persistence (Maya: 74.6%)

### 4.3 Implications for Archaeological Theory

These findings challenge traditional views of archaeological sites as "dead" remnants, revealing instead a spectrum of functional persistence. Archaeological features exist on a continuum from active to inactive, with some systems maintaining functional influence across centuries.

### 4.4 Applications to Heritage Management

Functional persistence has practical implications:
- **Heritage conservation**: Protecting functionally active archaeological systems
- **Landscape management**: Leveraging persistent infrastructure for contemporary needs
- **Climate adaptation**: Understanding landscape resilience through historical precedent
- **Indigenous knowledge**: Validating traditional management practices

### 4.5 Methodological Contributions

Our AFPI framework provides:
- **Quantitative assessment** of archaeological functional persistence
- **Reproducible methodology** applicable across cultural contexts
- **Integration framework** for archaeological and landscape science
- **Validation approach** for traditional ecological knowledge

## 5. Limitations and Future Directions

### 5.1 Current Limitations

- **Temporal resolution** limited by satellite revisit frequency
- **Ground validation** requires collaboration with local communities
- **Natural variability** may influence spectral signatures
- **Cultural interpretation** requires archaeological and anthropological expertise

### 5.2 Future Research Priorities

- **Expanded geographic coverage** across archaeological contexts
- **Ground-truthing campaigns** with community collaboration
- **Machine learning approaches** for automated detection
- **Integration with paleoecological data** for temporal validation
- **Policy framework development** for heritage-landscape integration

## 6. Conclusions

We demonstrate that archaeological infrastructure can maintain quantifiable functional influence on contemporary landscape processes. Our Anthropogenic Functional Persistence Index (AFPI) provides a framework for assessing "living archaeology" across different cultural and environmental contexts.

Key findings:
1. **Functional persistence is measurable** through multi-temporal remote sensing
2. **Persistence patterns vary** by cultural context and infrastructure type
3. **Ancient systems continue influencing** contemporary landscape processes
4. **Methodology is reproducible** across archaeological contexts

These results establish functional persistence as a quantifiable archaeological phenomenon and provide methodological foundations for integrating archaeological heritage with contemporary landscape management.
