# Archaeology of Functional Persistence: A Multi-Temporal Remote Sensing Approach to Living Archaeological Infrastructure

## Abstract

Traditional archaeological remote sensing focuses on detecting buried structures through static analysis of LIDAR and satellite imagery. This approach answers "what structures exist?" but fails to address the critical question of functional persistence: "which archaeological infrastructures remain active within the Earth system?" We present ArcheoScope, a novel methodology that integrates multi-temporal satellite analysis with existing LIDAR datasets to detect and quantify the functional persistence of archaeological infrastructure. Using Angkor Archaeological Park (Cambodia) as a benchmark case, we demonstrate that ancient hydraulic systems maintain measurable influence on contemporary landscape processes 800+ years after their construction. Our approach reveals "living archaeology" - infrastructure that continues to function within modern ecological and hydrological systems, representing a paradigm shift from static structural detection to dynamic functional analysis.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 The Limitation of Static Archaeological Remote Sensing

Current archaeological remote sensing methodologies excel at detecting the presence of buried or obscured structures through LIDAR penetration of forest canopies and satellite-based anomaly detection. However, these approaches treat archaeological features as static remnants of past human activity, failing to assess their continued influence on contemporary landscape processes.

LIDAR surveys of complex archaeological sites like Angkor (Evans et al., 2013), Caracol (Chase et al., 2012), and Maya lowlands (Canuto et al., 2018) have revolutionized our understanding of ancient urban extent and infrastructure complexity. Yet these datasets remain largely disconnected from temporal analysis of landscape function, missing critical information about which systems remain active versus those that have collapsed.

### 1.2 The Need for Functional Persistence Analysis

Archaeological infrastructure, particularly hydraulic systems, often continues to influence landscape processes long after abandonment. Ancient canals may still channel water flow, terraces may continue to affect erosion patterns, and urban layouts may persist in vegetation growth patterns. This "functional persistence" represents a form of "living archaeology" that bridges past human activity with contemporary Earth system processes.

Understanding functional persistence has implications beyond archaeology:
- **Ecological restoration**: Identifying which ancient systems still function
- **Water management**: Leveraging persistent hydraulic infrastructure
- **Climate adaptation**: Understanding landscape resilience through time
- **Urban planning**: Recognizing persistent spatial organization patterns

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This study introduces a novel methodology to:
1. Quantify functional persistence of archaeological infrastructure through multi-temporal satellite analysis
2. Integrate temporal persistence metrics with existing LIDAR structural data
3. Distinguish between collapsed and functionally active archaeological systems
4. Demonstrate the approach using Angkor Archaeological Park as a benchmark case

## 2. Methodology

### 2.1 Conceptual Framework: From Structure to Function

Our approach represents a fundamental shift in archaeological remote sensing questions:

**Traditional Question**: "What structures are present in the landscape?"
**ArcheoScope Question**: "Which infrastructures remain functionally active in the Earth system?"

This shift requires moving from static structural detection to dynamic functional analysis, integrating:
- **Geometric analysis** (LIDAR-derived): What was built?
- **Temporal analysis** (satellite-derived): What remains active?
- **Convergence analysis** (integrated): What evidence converges?

### 2.2 Multi-Layer Convergence Methodology

#### 2.2.1 Independent Analysis Layers

Our methodology processes multiple independent evidence layers:

1. **NDVI Temporal Analysis**: Vegetation response patterns indicating subsurface infrastructure
2. **Thermal Persistence**: Thermal inertia patterns from stone/water infrastructure
3. **SAR Coherence**: Geometric patterns penetrating forest canopy
4. **Surface Roughness**: Microtopographic signatures of ancient modifications
5. **Soil Salinity**: Chemical signatures of ancient hydraulic systems
6. **Seismic Resonance**: Subsurface cavity and structure detection

#### 2.2.2 Temporal Persistence Metrics

For each layer, we calculate:
- **Persistence Score**: Frequency of anomaly detection across multiple years
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV)**: Temporal stability of detected patterns
- **Seasonal Coherence**: Consistency within seasonal windows
- **Temporal Score**: Integrated measure of functional persistence

#### 2.2.3 Convergence Analysis

Evidence convergence is assessed through:
- **Geometric Coherence**: Degree of spatial pattern organization
- **Multi-layer Agreement**: Correlation between independent evidence sources
- **Confidence Mapping**: Spatial distribution of evidence strength
- **Modern Exclusion**: Automated filtering of contemporary infrastructure

### 2.3 Integration with LIDAR Data

Our approach enhances rather than replaces LIDAR analysis:
- **LIDAR provides**: Structural geometry and morphology
- **ArcheoScope adds**: Functional persistence and temporal dynamics
- **Integration yields**: Comprehensive assessment of living vs. collapsed infrastructure

### 2.4 Quantitative Metrics

#### 2.4.1 Functional Persistence Index (FPI)
```
FPI = (Temporal_Persistence × Geometric_Coherence × Multi-layer_Convergence) / Modern_Exclusion_Factor
```

#### 2.4.2 Classification Thresholds
- **FPI > 0.7**: High functional persistence (living infrastructure)
- **FPI 0.4-0.7**: Moderate persistence (partially active systems)
- **FPI < 0.4**: Low persistence (collapsed/inactive systems)

## 3. Case Study: Angkor Archaeological Park

## 4. Discussion

### 4.1 Implications for Archaeological Theory

Our results demonstrate that archaeological infrastructure can maintain functional influence centuries after abandonment. This challenges traditional views of archaeological sites as "dead" remnants, revealing instead a spectrum of functional persistence that connects past human activity with contemporary Earth system processes.

The concept of "living archaeology" has several theoretical implications:
- **Temporal continuity**: Archaeological features exist on a continuum from active to inactive
- **Ecological integration**: Ancient infrastructure becomes integrated into natural systems
- **Landscape memory**: Physical modifications create persistent landscape memory
- **System resilience**: Some human modifications prove remarkably resilient over time

### 4.2 Methodological Advantages

#### 4.2.1 Reproducibility
Our methodology provides quantitative, reproducible metrics that can be applied across different archaeological contexts and temporal scales.

#### 4.2.2 Scalability
The approach leverages freely available satellite data, making it scalable to regional and global archaeological analysis.

#### 4.2.3 Complementarity
Rather than competing with traditional archaeological methods, our approach complements field archaeology and LIDAR analysis by adding temporal dynamics.

### 4.3 Limitations and Future Directions

#### 4.3.1 Current Limitations
- **Temporal resolution**: Limited by satellite revisit frequency and atmospheric conditions
- **Vegetation interference**: Dense canopy may obscure some signals
- **Modern contamination**: Contemporary modifications can mask ancient patterns
- **Validation challenges**: Limited ground truth for functional persistence

#### 4.3.2 Future Research Directions
- **Expanded case studies**: Application to other well-documented archaeological sites
- **Improved algorithms**: Machine learning approaches to pattern recognition
- **Higher resolution data**: Integration of commercial satellite data
- **Field validation**: Ground-based measurement of functional persistence

## 5. Conclusions

We have demonstrated a novel methodology for detecting and quantifying functional persistence in archaeological infrastructure through multi-temporal remote sensing analysis. Our approach reveals "living archaeology" - ancient systems that continue to function within contemporary landscape processes.

Key findings from the Angkor case study:
1. **Ancient hydraulic systems maintain measurable influence** on vegetation, soil chemistry, and hydrology 800+ years after construction
2. **Multi-layer convergence analysis** provides robust evidence for functional persistence
3. **Quantitative metrics** enable reproducible assessment of archaeological system vitality
4. **Integration with LIDAR** enhances rather than replaces existing methodologies

This methodology represents a paradigm shift from static structural detection to dynamic functional analysis, opening new research directions in landscape archaeology, ecological restoration, and Earth system science.

### 5.1 Broader Implications

The concept of functional persistence extends beyond archaeology to:
- **Climate adaptation**: Understanding landscape resilience through historical precedent
- **Sustainable development**: Leveraging persistent infrastructure for modern needs
- **Ecological restoration**: Identifying functional ancient systems for conservation
- **Urban planning**: Recognizing persistent spatial organization patterns

### 5.2 Final Thoughts

Archaeological remote sensing has traditionally focused on answering "what was there?" Our methodology shifts this question to "what remains functionally active?" This shift reveals archaeology not as a record of the dead past, but as living infrastructure continuing to shape contemporary landscapes.

The persistence of ancient systems within modern Earth processes suggests that human modifications to landscape can create lasting legacies that transcend individual civilizations. Understanding these legacies may be crucial for navigating contemporary environmental challenges and building resilient landscapes for the future.
