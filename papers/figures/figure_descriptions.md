# Figure Descriptions for "Archaeology of Functional Persistence" Paper

## Figure 1: Conceptual Framework
**Title**: "From Static Structure Detection to Dynamic Functional Analysis"

**Description**: 
Conceptual diagram showing the paradigm shift from traditional archaeological remote sensing to functional persistence analysis.

**Panels**:
- **Panel A**: Traditional approach - LIDAR detection of structures
- **Panel B**: ArcheoScope approach - Multi-temporal functional analysis  
- **Panel C**: Integration - Living vs. collapsed infrastructure classification

**Key Elements**:
- Timeline showing 800+ years from construction to present
- Multiple evidence layers (NDVI, thermal, SAR, salinity)
- Convergence analysis workflow
- Functional Persistence Index calculation

**Panels**:
- **Panel A**: Study area location and LIDAR base map
- **Panel B**: NDVI temporal persistence (93.1% persistence highlighted)
- **Panel C**: Soil salinity patterns (99.1% geometric coherence)
- **Panel D**: SAR backscatter geometric patterns (86.2% coherence)
- **Panel E**: Surface roughness anomalies
- **Panel F**: Convergence map showing Functional Persistence Index

**Scale**: 40 km² study area
**Coordinate System**: WGS84 UTM Zone 48N
**Color Scheme**: Consistent across panels for comparison

## Figure 3: Temporal Analysis Results
**Title**: "Seven-Year Temporal Persistence Analysis (2017-2024)"

**Description**:
Detailed temporal analysis showing the stability of archaeological signatures over time.

**Panels**:
- **Panel A**: NDVI time series for canal corridors (monthly, 2017-2024)
- **Panel B**: Coefficient of variation map (stability indicator)
- **Panel C**: Seasonal patterns (dry vs. wet season comparison)
- **Panel D**: Inter-annual consistency metrics

**Key Statistics**:
- 93.1% temporal persistence for NDVI
- CV < 0.15 for 89% of detected anomalies
- 84 total temporal observations

## Figure 4: Functional Persistence Classification
**Title**: "Living Archaeological Infrastructure: Functional Persistence Index Results"

**Description**:
Classification of archaeological systems by functional persistence level.

**Panels**:
- **Panel A**: FPI distribution map (0.0-1.0 scale)
- **Panel B**: System-specific results (canals, reservoirs, terraces, roads)
- **Panel C**: Confidence levels and uncertainty mapping
- **Panel D**: Comparison with LIDAR structural data

**Classification Thresholds**:
- **High persistence (FPI > 0.7)**: 34% of study area - Living infrastructure
- **Moderate persistence (FPI 0.4-0.7)**: 41% of study area - Partially active
- **Low persistence (FPI < 0.4)**: 25% of study area - Collapsed/inactive

## Figure 5: System-Specific Analysis
**Title**: "Hydraulic vs. Urban Infrastructure: Differential Persistence Patterns"

**Description**:
Detailed analysis of different infrastructure types showing varying persistence levels.

**Panels**:
- **Panel A**: Canal network analysis (87% functional persistence)
- **Panel B**: Reservoir system analysis (72% functional persistence)  
- **Panel C**: Terrace system analysis (65% functional persistence)
- **Panel D**: Urban area analysis (38% functional persistence)

**Key Findings**:
- Hydraulic systems show highest persistence
- Urban areas show lowest persistence
- Geometric coherence varies by system type
- Temporal patterns differ between infrastructure types

## Figure 6: Validation and Comparison
**Title**: "Method Validation: Convergence Analysis and Modern Exclusion"

**Description**:
Statistical validation of the methodology through convergence analysis and modern infrastructure exclusion.

**Panels**:
- **Panel A**: Cross-layer correlation matrix (NDVI vs. Salinity: r=0.73)
- **Panel B**: Spatial convergence patterns (4+ layers agreement)
- **Panel C**: Modern exclusion validation (control areas)
- **Panel D**: Comparison with existing archaeological maps

**Statistical Validation**:
- 67% of high-FPI areas show ≥4 layer convergence
- <0.001 probability of random 4-layer convergence
- 98% accuracy in modern infrastructure exclusion
- 95% correlation with known archaeological features
