## Additional Terms for Scientific Use

This software is designed as a scientific instrument for glaciological research.
Users are encouraged to:

1. **Cite appropriately** when using in academic work
2. **Validate results** with field data when possible  
3. **Understand limitations** as documented in the system
4. **Contribute improvements** back to the community
5. **Use responsibly** within the spatial scale guidelines

## Disclaimer

CryoScope is designed as an "amplifier of spatial hypotheses" for scientific 
exploration, not as a definitive detector of glaciological truths. Results 
should be interpreted within the context of the system's documented limitations 
and validated through appropriate scientific methods.

The developers make no claims about the absolute accuracy of results and 
encourage users to treat outputs as hypotheses for further investigation 
rather than conclusive findings.
