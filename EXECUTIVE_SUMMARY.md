# ArcheoScope: Executive Summary

**Archaeological Remote Sensing Framework for Survey Prioritization**

---

## What is ArcheoScope?

ArcheoScope is a **scientific screening tool** that analyzes satellite data to identify areas with elevated probability of containing buried or obscured archaeological features. It serves as a **survey prioritization system** for archaeological research, not an archaeological discovery tool.

### Key Distinction
- ✅ **Screening Tool**: Identifies areas for further archaeological investigation
- ❌ **Not a Discovery System**: Does not make archaeological identifications

## Core Innovation

### Traditional Approach: Visual Detection
- Looks for recognizable shapes in high-resolution imagery
- Limited to visible surface features
- Works only in specific landscapes (like Nazca desert)
- Susceptible to human bias and pareidolia

### ArcheoScope Approach: Behavioral Pattern Analysis
- Analyzes how landscapes behave across time and multiple data types
- Detects buried and obscured features through indirect signatures
- Works across diverse geographical and cultural contexts
- Methodologically transparent and scientifically reproducible

## Scientific Principle

> **"Ancient human interventions create persistent spatial signatures that cannot be explained by current natural processes alone."**

ArcheoScope detects these signatures through:
- **Multi-spectral analysis**: Vegetation, thermal, surface roughness data
- **Temporal persistence**: Patterns that remain stable across years
- **Geometric coherence**: Spatial organization inconsistent with natural processes
- **Natural process exclusion**: Rigorous elimination of non-archaeological explanations

## Competitive Advantages

### vs. Nazca AI Research (Yamagata University + IBM)
| Aspect | Nazca AI | ArcheoScope |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Scope** | Nazca desert only | Global applicability |
| **Method** | Visual pattern recognition | Behavioral signature analysis |
| **Explainability** | Limited | Complete transparency |
| **Generalization** | Landscape-specific | Cross-cultural validation |
| **Scientific Rigor** | Pattern matching | Natural process exclusion |

### Key Differentiators
1. **Generalizable Methodology**: Works across diverse landscapes and cultures
2. **Scientific Explainability**: Every decision fully documented and explained
3. **Natural Process Modeling**: Rigorous exclusion of non-archaeological explanations
4. **Academic Validation**: Blind testing against known archaeological sites
5. **Methodological Transparency**: Peer-reviewable and reproducible approach

## Performance Metrics

### Testing Results (January 2026)
