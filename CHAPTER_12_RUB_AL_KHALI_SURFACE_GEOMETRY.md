# CHAPTER 12: THE VISIBLE ANOMALIES (RUB' AL KHALI)
**Ref:** AS-TR-2026-001-CH12
**Discovery:** Surface Geoglyphs & Lithic Structures
**Region:** Rub' al Khali Empty Quarter

## 12.1 THE "ANTI-DUNE" LOGIC
While previous chapters focused on the invisible subsurface networks (SAR/Archaeological Noise), Chapter 12 explores structures visible in the optical spectrum. ArcheoScope was recalibrated to ignore hydrology and focus on **Geometric Persistence**: patterns that resist aeolian erosion and cut across active dune systems.

## 12.2 GEO-RAK-01: THE PALEOLAKE ALIGNMENT
- **Coords:** `20.18°N, 50.92°E`
- **Visual Score:** **63.5%**
- **Orthogonality:** **0.59**
- **Interpretation:** A Series of stone alignments (lithic scatters) appearing at the edge of the secondary paleolake. Unlike the subsurface settlement, these are surface-level marks, possibly representing ritual boundaries or animal traps (Desert Kites).
- **DB UUID:** `d81e443f-8891-48d3-875f-5bf66bbf61a3`

## 12.3 GEO-RAK-02: THE TRANSIT HUB PERSISTENCE
- **Coords:** `20.48°N, 50.55°E`
- **Visual Score:** **62.3%**
- **Interpretation:** Subtle geometric trace cutting across a transverse dune. The straightness of the signal contradicts the local wind-formed curvature, suggesting a constructed path or a foundation wall emerging from the sand.
- **DB UUID:** `bfe6e71c-2ae6-43da-9be8-85c7aa45b55d`

## 12.4 THE "SURFACE INSISTENCE" PHENOMENON
ArcheoScope has identified that Rub' al Khali's surface is not just sand; it is a parchment. The **Surface Geometry Scan** validates that human intervention is persistent enough to remain visible despite millennia of environmental stress.
