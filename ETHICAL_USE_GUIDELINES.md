# ArcheoScope Ethical Use Guidelines

**Version 1.0 | January 2026**

## Preamble

Archaeological heritage belongs to all humanity and requires protection, respect, and responsible stewardship. ArcheoScope is designed to support legitimate archaeological research and heritage management while preventing misuse that could harm archaeological sites or violate cultural rights.

## Core Ethical Principles

### 1. Archaeological Heritage Protection
- Archaeological sites are **non-renewable cultural resources**
- **Preservation takes precedence** over research convenience
- **Community rights** supersede research interests
- **Professional standards** must be maintained at all times

### 2. Scientific Integrity
- **Transparency** in methodology and limitations
- **Reproducibility** of analysis and results
- **Peer review** and professional validation
- **Uncertainty acknowledgment** in all interpretations

### 3. Cultural Respect
