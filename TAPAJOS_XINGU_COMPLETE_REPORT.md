# Tapajós-Xingu Exemplar: Complete Methodological Breakthrough Report

## Executive Summary

**METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT**: The Tapajós-Xingu interfluvial core zone, historically classified as "pristine forest" and used as ecological control for decades, exhibits high anthropogenic functional persistence (AFPI = 0.907) with clear differentiation from natural control areas (ΔAFPI = 0.325).

**SIGNIFICANCE**: This result demonstrates systematic false-negative bias in visually driven archaeological detection frameworks.

## Case Study Overview

### Site Selection Rationale
The Tapajós-Xingu interfluvial zone represents the **ideal exemplar** for demonstrating systematic false negatives in visual archaeology:

1. **Historical pristine classification**: Used as ecological control and "intact Amazonia" reference
2. **No visible architecture**: Lacks geometric features detectable by traditional methods
3. **Fragmentary evidence**: Dispersed terra preta, vegetation anomalies, unexplained microtopography
4. **Controlled comparison**: Same climate/geology/biome neutralizes environmental arguments

### Coordinates and Context
- **Primary site**: -4.25°S, 54.70°W (Interfluvial core zone)
- **Control area**: -4.10°S, 54.50°W (Natural forest baseline)
- **Classification**: Pristine forest control / Intact Amazonia reference
- **Archaeological status**: Dispersed occupation, low density
- **Control narrative**: "Used as ecological control for decades"
