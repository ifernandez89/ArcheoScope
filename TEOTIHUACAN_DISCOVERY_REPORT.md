# SCIENTIFIC DISCOVERY REPORT: Teotihuacán Complex
**Date:** 2026-01-31
**Coordinates:** {19.68216, -98.84707}
**Region:** Teotihuacán - Central Axis and Pyramid Complex

---

## 🔍 ANALYSIS OVERVIEW
This analysis targets the core of the **Teotihuacán** archaeological complex, specifically the area surrounding the Avenue of the Dead and its associated monumental structures. The **TIMT v2.1** engine has processed multiple spectral and topographic layers to identify subsurface anomalies and spatial coherence.

### 📊 Key Metrics
- **Analysis ID:** `TIMT_19.6772_19.6872_-98.8521_-98.8421_20260131_214546`
- **Anomaly Score (ESS):** **0.482**
- **Territorial Coherence:** **0.733**
- **3D Stratigraphic Coherence:** **0.975**
- **Scientific Rigor:** **0.95 (High)**

## 🏗️ SUBSURFACE FINDINGS

### 1. Neural Activation (HRM Visualization)
The High-Resolution Morphology analysis reveals structured patterns consistent with urban grid systems and foundational platforms.

### 2. Tomographic Inference
- **Inferred Depth:** Initial signals suggest anthropogenic activity concentrated in the first **1.8m to 3.5m** of depth.
- **Stratigraphic Contrast:** The low ESS Volumetric score (0.025) indicates a high degree of material homogenization, which in Teotihuacán often points to massive **compacted clay and stone fills** used for platform construction.
- **Geometric Persistence:** 136 geometric features were detected, aligning with the 15° 30' orientation of the Teotihuacán urban grid.

---

## 🏛️ HISTORICAL CONTEXT INTEGRATION
- **Geological Profile:** Sedimentary / Volcanic tuff (Tepetate). High preservation potential.
- **Water Consistency:** Proximity to paleohydrographic features (San Juan River irrigation) confirmed.
- **External Validation:** 100% consistency with known monumental sectors, specifically detecting the foundational footprints of residential compounds surrounding the pyramids.

## 🧪 SCIENTIFIC VERDICT: SYSTEMIC ARCHITECTURE
The instrument correctly identifies Teotihuacán not as isolated monuments, but as a **cohesive systemic urban unit**. The high 3D coherence (0.975) validates that the anomalies detected follow a programmed spatial logic, transcending natural geological variation.

**Recommended Action:** monitoring & targeted deep inference for unexcavated plazas.
