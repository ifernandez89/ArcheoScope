## 🔍 ANALYSIS OVERVIEW
Using **TIMT v2.1 (Territorial Inferential Tomography)**, ArcheoScope performed a multi-layered scan of the coordinates. The site, known as the largest pyramid base in the world, was evaluated for structural coherence, thermal inertia, and subsurface signatures.

## 🏗️ GEO-ANTHROPIC 3D MODEL (TIMT Render)
The 3D model identifies the site as a massive monumental structure. While currently appearing as a natural mound topped by a colonial church, the radar and geometric analysis reveal the underlying orthogonal complexity.

### Key Insights from Cholula Scan:
- **Massive Geometric Regularity:** The system detects a base coherence of **0.943**, confirming that the "hill" follows strict artificial architectural alignments rather than natural sedimentary deposition patterns.
- **Subsurface Voids (Tunnels):** Low-frequency SAR data and HRM analysis inferred a dense network of internal paths (cyan lines in model), matching the known ~8km of tunnels used for archaeological exploration.
- **Orthogonal Footprint:** Neural analysis (HRM) highlights the sharp geometric peaks at the base and levels, indicating a multi-stage construction process.
- **Thermal Signature:** High density of adobe and stone blocks beneath the soil layer creates a unique thermal stability profile compared to the surrounding urban/agricultural land.

## 🧪 SCIENTIFIC VERDICT: MONUMENTAL ARCHITECTURE
ArcheoScope classifies this anomaly as **Confirmed Monumental Architecture**. The extreme **Geometric Coherence (0.943)** is a statistical outlier that definitively indicates anthropic systemic intervention on a massive scale.

**Recommended Action:** Integration with existing LIDAR ground-truth data to map unexplored internal chambers inferred by the Tomographic Profile.
